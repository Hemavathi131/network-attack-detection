# PacketPatrolAI 

## Description

PacketPatrolAI is an advanced machine learning project that uses Netflow V9 data to detect and prevent network attacks. The project is designed to identify three major types of network attacks: port scanning, denial of service (DoS), and malware. The project consists of two files: train_net.csv and test_net.csv. The train_net.csv file provides information on when a particular alert is likely to happen, while the test_net.csv file is used to validate the performance of the model.

PacketPatrolAI provides a robust detection capability that empowers your network's security. Its machine learning-based approach enables it to recognize attack patterns in real-time, making it an essential tool for safeguarding your network against cyber threats. The project is implemented in Python, utilizing popular machine learning libraries like scikit-learn and Pandas.
